# "Exploring Concurrency in Go Programs and Continuous Dynamic Race Detection Deployment Strategies"

This is a Go program that demonstrates concurrency using Goroutines and Mutexes.

The program first defines a shared integer variable called counter, and a sync.Mutex variable called mutex that will be used to synchronize access to the shared counter.

Then, the program defines two functions: increment() and decrement(), both of which perform 1000 increments and decrements on the shared counter variable while acquiring and releasing the mutex to synchronize access to the counter.

The program also defines a third function fetchWebData(), which fetches data from a web page.

In the main function, the program initializes the shared counter variable, and launches 5 Goroutines to concurrently execute the increment(), decrement(), and fetchWebData() functions. The program then waits for 2 seconds using the time.Sleep() function to allow the Goroutines to complete before printing the final value of the counter variable.

Overall, the program demonstrates how Go can be used to write concurrent programs using Goroutines and Mutexes to synchronize access to shared variables.

# python

- This code defines a global variable "counter" and a list "counter_data" to store the counter values over time. The increment() and decrement() functions update the counter variable and append the current value to the counter_data list. The cProfile module is used to profile the performance of the code, and the resulting counter data is saved to a CSV file.

- The pandas library is used to read the counter data from the CSV file and calculate various statistics like the mean, standard deviation, and maximum value. The matplotlib library is used to create a simple line plot of the counter data.

- This code  sends a request to a Golang server to receive JSON data, performs data analysis on the received data using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, profiles the code to analyze performance, saves counter data to a CSV file, calculates statistics on the counter data, and plots the counter data using Matplotlib.
