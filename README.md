# In this paper, I discuss the characteristics of concurrency in Go programs and a deployment strategy for detecting races continuously using dynamic race detection

- Based on observed (including fixed) data races, we elaborate on
the Go language paradigms that make it easy to introduce
races in Go programs.
- I hope that this work will inspire future work towards enabling dynamic race detection during continuous integration, developing program analyses for detecting Go races, and designing language features such that their interplay with concurrency does not easily introduce races.

# python

- This code defines a global variable "counter" and a list "counter_data" to store the counter values over time. The increment() and decrement() functions update the counter variable and append the current value to the counter_data list. The cProfile module is used to profile the performance of the code, and the resulting counter data is saved to a CSV file.

- The pandas library is used to read the counter data from the CSV file and calculate various statistics like the mean, standard deviation, and maximum value. The matplotlib library is used to create a simple line plot of the counter data.

- This code  sends a request to a Golang server to receive JSON data, performs data analysis on the received data using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, profiles the code to analyze performance, saves counter data to a CSV file, calculates statistics on the counter data, and plots the counter data using Matplotlib.
