# GOLANG  REST API

- This Go code defines an HTTP server that listens for requests on port 8200. It has three endpoints: /,' /contact, and /submit.The home function handles requests to the / endpoint and simply writes a welcome message to the HTTP response writer.The contact function handles requests to the /contact endpoint and writes an email address to the HTTP response writer.

- The submit function handles requests to the /submit endpoint and processes form data sent in the request body. It parses the form data, gets the values for the name and email fields, and writes a thank-you message to the HTTP response writer. The main function defines the HTTP endpoints and handlers using the http.HandleFunc function, and starts the HTTP server using the http.ListenAndServe function.

## PYTHON REQUESTS

- This Python code uses the requests library to send HTTP requests to the Go HTTP server running on port 8200.
The first request sends an HTTP GET request to the / endpoint and prints the response. The second request sends an HTTP GET request to the /contact endpoint and prints the response. The third request sends an HTTP POST request to the /submit endpoint with some data and prints the response.

**To run the Go code, you can save it to a file named "main.go" and run it using the "go run" command:**

```go
go run main.go
```

all: main

clean:
 rm -f bin/main
bin:
 mkdir bin

thread: main.go bin
 go build --o bin main.go

Use a more efficient data transfer format: The current code uses plain text to transfer data between the Go HTTP server and the Python client. You can consider using a more efficient data transfer format, such as JSON or Protobuf, to reduce the size of the data being transferred and improve performance.

Add authentication and authorization: The current code does not include any authentication or authorization mechanisms, which can lead to security issues. You can add appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as token-based authentication, to ensure that only authorized users can access the server.

Improve code organization and documentation: You can improve the overall organization and documentation of the code to make it easier to understand and maintain. This can include adding comments, organizing the code into separate modules, and following best practices for code style and documentation.

Use a production-ready HTTP server: The current code uses the built-in http package in Go, which may not be suitable for production use. You can consider using a more robust and production-ready HTTP server, such as gin or echo, to improve performance and scalability.
