<<<<<<< Updated upstream
**In this project**, I have written a Go program that demonstrates concurrency using Goroutines and Mutexes. The program uses a shared integer variable called counter and a sync.Mutex variable called mutex to synchronize access to the counter. The program also includes a function called fetchWebData() that fetches data from a web page.

To complement the Go program, I have also written a Python script that defines a global variable "counter" and a list "counter_data" to store the counter values over time. The increment() and decrement() functions update the counter variable and append the current value to the counter_data list. The script also uses the cProfile module to profile the performance of the code and saves the resulting counter data to a CSV file.

Using the pandas library, I have read the counter data from the CSV file and calculated various statistics like the mean, standard deviation, and maximum value. I have also used the matplotlib library to create a simple line plot of the counter data.

Furthermore, I have sent a request to a Golang server to receive JSON data, performed data analysis on the received data using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, profiled the code to analyze performance, saved counter data to a CSV file, calculated statistics on the counter data, and plotted the counter data using Matplotlib. Through this project, I have learned valuable skills in building distributed systems, data analysis, and profiling in both Go and Python.

# Golang REST API?

*What is REST API*
-REST (Representational State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface) is used to deliver user functionality when dealing with websites. HTTP requests are used to communicate with REST APIs so users can navigate a URL website. These URLs can return certain information that is stored as part of the API. Any changes to data or information is done by accessing the database of that particular APIâ€™s URL. Most APIs these days would return a response to us in the form of JSON.
