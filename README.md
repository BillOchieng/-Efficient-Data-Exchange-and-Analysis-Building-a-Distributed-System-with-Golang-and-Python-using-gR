**In this project**, I have written a Go program that demonstrates concurrency using Goroutines and Mutexes. The program uses a shared integer variable called counter and a sync.Mutex variable called mutex to synchronize access to the counter. The program also includes a function called fetchWebData() that fetches data from a web page.

To complement the Go program, I have also written a Python script that defines a global variable "counter" and a list "counter_data" to store the counter values over time. The increment() and decrement() functions update the counter variable and append the current value to the counter_data list. The script also uses the cProfile module to profile the performance of the code and saves the resulting counter data to a CSV file.

Using the pandas library, I have read the counter data from the CSV file and calculated various statistics like the mean, standard deviation, and maximum value. I have also used the matplotlib library to create a simple line plot of the counter data.

Furthermore, I have sent a request to a Golang server to receive JSON data, performed data analysis on the received data using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, profiled the code to analyze performance, saved counter data to a CSV file, calculated statistics on the counter data, and plotted the counter data using Matplotlib. Through this project, I have learned valuable skills in building distributed systems, data analysis, and profiling in both Go and Python.
