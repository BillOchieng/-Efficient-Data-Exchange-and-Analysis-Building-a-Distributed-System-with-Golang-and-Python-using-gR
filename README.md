## Development of a Basic Web-Based Form Application with Database Integration: A Technical Overview

## Introduction

- This project is a simple web application that provides a basic RESTful API to retrieve and manipulate user data. The application is developed using the Go programming language and is integrated with a database to store user data. The project includes a configuration file (config.json), a client-side Python script (client.py) to interact with the API, and the main source code file for the web application (main.go).

## Files

- config.json: This file contains the configuration settings for the web application, such as the server port, database name, username, and password.

- client.py: This is a simple client script written in Python that demonstrates how to interact with the RESTful API provided by the web application. The script allows users to create, read, update, and delete user data.

- main.go: This is the main source code file for the web application. It contains the handlers for each of the API endpoints, as well as the main function that initializes the HTTP server and connects to the database.

## How it Works

When the web application is launched, the main function in 'main.go' reads the configuration settings from "config.json", initializes a connection to the database, and then starts an HTTP server on the specified port. The HTTP server listens for incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate handler function based on the URL path. The web application is integrated with a database to store user data. The user data is represented using the User struct in main.go, and each user is stored as a row in the database.

### API Endpoints

- /: This endpoint returns a simple welcome message.
- /contact: This endpoint returns the contact email address for the website.
- /submit: This endpoint is used to submit a form with name and email fields. It returns a JSON response thanking the user for submitting the form and indicating that they will be contacted at the provided email address. The user data is stored in the database.
/users: This endpoint returns a list of all users in JSON format. It also supports creating new users, updating existing users, and deleting users. The user data is stored in the database.
Real-world Application
This project can be used as a starting point for building more complex RESTful API services. It demonstrates how to handle HTTP requests, parse JSON data, and interact with a database to store and retrieve data. With additional development, this web application could be extended to support additional API endpoints, more complex data models, and integration with external services or databases. A real-world application for this project is a customer relationship management (CRM) system. The basic user data model provided in this project could be expanded to include additional fields such as customer addresses, phone numbers, and order histories. Additional API endpoints could be added to support features such as searching for customers by name, creating and updating orders, and generating reports on customer activity. The integration with a database provides a scalable and efficient solution for storing and retrieving large amounts of customer data.
