# GOLANG  REST API

- This Go code defines an HTTP server that listens for requests on port 8200. It has three endpoints: /,' /contact, and /submit.The home function handles requests to the / endpoint and simply writes a welcome message to the HTTP response writer.The contact function handles requests to the /contact endpoint and writes an email address to the HTTP response writer.

- The submit function handles requests to the /submit endpoint and processes form data sent in the request body. It parses the form data, gets the values for the name and email fields, and writes a thank-you message to the HTTP response writer. The main function defines the HTTP endpoints and handlers using the http.HandleFunc function, and starts the HTTP server using the http.ListenAndServe function.

## PYTHON REQUESTS

- This Python code uses the requests library to send HTTP requests to the Go HTTP server running on port 8200.
The first request sends an HTTP GET request to the / endpoint and prints the response. The second request sends an HTTP GET request to the /contact endpoint and prints the response. The third request sends an HTTP POST request to the /submit endpoint with some data and prints the response.

**To run the Go code, you can save it to a file named "main.go" and run it using the "go run" command:**

```go
go run main.go
```

all: main

clean:
 rm -f bin/main
bin:
 mkdir bin

thread: main.go bin
 go build --o bin main.go

./main
python3client.py

Add authentication and authorization: The current code does not include any authentication or authorization mechanisms, which can lead to security issues. You can add appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as token-based authentication, to ensure that only authorized users can access the server.

*Title: Automated Email Sender*

Introduction:
The Automated Email Sender is a project that uses a combination of Go and Python programming languages to automate the sending of emails. The idea of this project is to demonstrate how different programming languages can be used together to solve a common problem. The solution is designed to be scalable and adaptable, making it suitable for small to large scale businesses.

Problem:
Sending personalized emails to a large number of customers or clients can be a daunting and time-consuming task. This process becomes even more difficult when the number of recipients grows larger. Therefore, automating the email sending process is crucial in modern businesses to save time and resources.

Solution:
The Automated Email Sender solves the problem by automating the sending of emails using Go and Python programming languages. The project uses a Go server that handles incoming requests and sends them to a Python script that handles the email sending process. The Python script makes use of the SMTP library to send emails. The data is sent between the two programming languages in JSON format, which is a popular data interchange format.

Benefits:
The combination of Go and Python languages provides a scalable and adaptable solution that can handle a large number of emails. Go's performance and concurrency features make it suitable for handling a large number of requests, while Python's simplicity and ease of use make it ideal for handling email sending. JSON format makes data interchange seamless between the two programming languages, enabling the project to be used in any language.

Technical Details:
The Go server handles incoming requests and sends them to the Python script using the requests library. The Python script is responsible for handling the email sending process, which is done using the SMTP library. The data is sent between the two programming languages in JSON format using the json library.

Conclusion:
The Automated Email Sender project demonstrates the benefits of using a combination of programming languages to solve a common problem. By leveraging the strengths of Go and Python, the solution provides a scalable and adaptable system that can handle a large number of emails. JSON format makes the data interchange between programming languages seamless, enabling the project to be used in any language.
