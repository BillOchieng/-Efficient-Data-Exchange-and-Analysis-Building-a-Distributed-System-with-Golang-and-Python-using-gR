# On the Python side, you could use the `requests` library to send a request to the Golang server and receive the JSON data:

import requests

response = requests.get('http://localhost:8080/')
data = response.json()

# Perform data analysis on data

#In this example, we use the `get` method from the `requests` library to send a GET request to the Golang server running on `localhost:8080`. We then use the `json` method to decode the JSON data received from the server.

# Once you have received the data in Python, you can use libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform data analysis and visualization.
